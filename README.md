A notebook with all the tools I want for Stable Diffusion:
- CLIP guidance
- LPIPS guidance
- support for text-inversion bin loading from the huggingface hub
  - (you can load the entire sd_concepts library with one toggle or specify which concepts to load from any user/organization)
- attention slicing for more memory efficient sampling
- perlin inits for better overall image coherence at high resolutions
- image inits
- multiple models to choose from

(link to open the code in a free GPU instance from Google Colab [here](https://t.co/zCV2xsC3UE))

more to come, feel free to add code and submit a PR (yipee for open source)
